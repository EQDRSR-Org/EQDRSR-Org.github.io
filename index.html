    <h2>Medical Writing Consultant</h2>
    <p>
        I am a retired Medical Physician with extensive experience in the Emergency Room, Hospital, 
        and a private Family Medical office based in a rural log cabin. I have served as a Medical Legal consultant.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I am writing several novels and, as a sideline, offering my services as a technical writing consultant. 
        I can add my secret sauce to your wordplay to enhance it into a fascinating novel. 
        I will work with you to transform your work, making it accurate and understandable for readers of any age.

    <h2>1. Trash Removal</h2>
    <p>
        First project on the two acres:
        <br>a) Local friends & I removed 5 truck & trailer loads.
        <br>b) I coordinated with the National Forest Service to remove 1 truck & trailer load from the National Forest across the creek.
    </p>
    <p>
        The disrespect for our biosphere home by the sapien species never ceases to amaze me.

    <h2>HERP – Hemlock Ecosystem Restoration Project</h2>
    <p>
        The second-step project involved rescuing roadside at-risk & bonsai hemlocks, transplanting some up to one-footers into containers, 
        and thinning up to 10-foot hemlock trees along with clearing brush and other competitive species.
    </p>
    <p>
        This led to spring 2024’s next step: feeding, thinning, and adelgid control — remarkably successful. 
        The leaf growth and tree health exceeded expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The plan for spring 2025 includes transplanting them across the two acres and locally.
